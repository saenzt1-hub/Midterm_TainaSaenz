In this app, you'll be able to see places I'd like to travel to, hence the name "Taina's Travels".
These places are: Hawaii, Puerto Rico, South Korea, Japan, Canada, Italy, Germany, Thailand, Scotland, and Iceland!
While in the app, you can click on a destination, where it will take you to a new view.
This view will show you the picture of the location, with "DESTINATION DETAILS" right above it.
Then, you'll also be able to see the name of the location and a description of the place.
Lastly, you can go back to the main view by clicking the white button in the top left corner of the screen.
This will take you back to the main page, where you can do the exact same for the rest of the locations.
